QuickSelect
=================

A *Quick* replacement for the good old *Select* tags.

Why I built this plugin?
------------------

This should be useful if you need to style some select box, without having extra headaches to worry about.

I hope you like this!

Why should you use this instead of another plugin?
-------------------------------------------

* I try to keep this as lightweight and fast as possible. It's only around 4KB minified.
* It's also responsive.
* It works with events tied to the original select box.
* It let's you stylize almost the entire selectbox layout.
* It key navigable, just like the standard select tag.
 
Optional parameters
-------------------

QuickSelect supports optional parameters.

### iconUp
The icon that will be displayed when the dropdown is visible.  
**Default: "&#9650;"**

### iconDown
The icon that will be displayed when the dropdown is not visible.  
**Default: "&#9660;"**

### minElemsBeforeGoingUp
This is the minimun number of options to display below the select box before trying to display it above the box. (You'll get this better if you play with it yourself.)
**Default: 3**

### openEffect
**Default: "fadeIn"**

This parameter allows you to override the effect used when the dropdown opens. If you want it to slide, just set this parameter to something like this.

```javascript
$('#myCoolSelect').QuickSelect({
	openEffect: function(){
		$(this).slideDown(100);
	}
});
```

### closeEffect
**Default: "hide"**

Same as above, but this is the effect used when the dropdown closes.

How to Use
----------

If you don't want to write any extra JS code, just add the *quick-select* class to your select box, and the plugin will automatically initialize.


If you have something like this in your HTML.
```html
<select id="myCoolSelect" name="data">
	<option value="1">This is an option</option>
	<option value="2">And this is another</option>
	<option value="3">Here comes the boom</option>
	<option value="4">Kaboom!</option>
</select>
```

Just do this with jQuery and you'll be good to go.
```javascript
$('#myCoolSelect').QuickSelect();
```

Maybe using some FontAwesome icons as an option?
```javascript
$('#myCoolSelect').QuickSelect({
	iconDown: '<i class="icon-collapse"></i>',
	iconUp:'<i class="icon-collapse-top"></i>'
});
```

IE Support
----------

I haven't tested this on IE, but should work from IE8 and up. I'll update this later.

TO-DOs
----------

* Support for multiple enabled selectors.
* Support for optgroups.
