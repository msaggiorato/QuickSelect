(You'll get this better if you play with it yourself.)\r\n**Default: 3**\r\n\r\nHow to Use\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to write any extra JS code, just add the *quick-select* class to your select box, and the plugin will automatically initialize.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have something like this in your HTML.\r\n```html\r\n<select id=\"myCoolSelect\" name=\"data\">\r\n\t<option value=\"1\">This is an option</option>\r\n\t<option value=\"2\">And this is another</option>\r\n\t<option value=\"3\">Here comes the boom</option>\r\n\t<option value=\"4\">Kaboom!</option>\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust do this with jQuery and you'll be good to go.\r\n```javascript\r\n$('#myCoolSelect').QuickSelect();\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe using some FontAwesome icons as an option?\r\n```javascript\r\n$('#myCoolSelect').QuickSelect({\r\n\ticonDown: '<i class=\"icon-collapse\"></i>',\r\n\ticonUp:'<i class=\"icon-collapse-top\"></i>'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIE Support\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI haven't tested this on IE, but should work from IE8 and up. I'll update this later.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2014 Matias Saggiorato.\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
